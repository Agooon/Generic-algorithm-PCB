# Generic-algorithm-PCB


## Purpose
Program, which shows a problem of finding best path to connect points on printed circuit board

## What Generic-algorithm-PCB provides?
- The solution for connecting points on complicated (to some extent!)
- Seperation of operators for easy replacement (some can be improved, especially the mutation one)
- My own solution for repairing path (after for example crossing itself)

## Research with comparing generic and random algorithms
Can be found in **Sierakowski-Adam-Sprawozdanie.pdf**
